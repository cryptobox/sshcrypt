SSHSIGN(1)

sshsign generates a signature of the input file, or verifies a signature
againstr

USAGE
sshsign [-afv] [-k keyfile] [-file filename] input file

	-a	ASCII-armour the signature. Only applies when generaitng
		signatures.
	-f	force overwriting of output files.
	-file filename
                When signing a file, this is the file that the
                signature should be saved as. It defaults to standard
                output. When verifying a signature, this is the
                signature to be verified.
	-k keyfile
		When signing a file, this is the private key to use
		for signatures. When verifying a signature, this is
		the public key to verify the signature with.
	-v	Verify a signature. The default is to sign a file.
	input file
		This is the file that should be signed, or for which
		the signature was generated.


EXAMPLES
To sign the file release.tgz with the default SSH key, signing to
release.tgz.sig:
	sshcrypt -file release.tgz.sig release.tgz

To verify the previously signed file using the ~/.ssh/id_ecdsa.pub key:
	sshcrypt -v -k ~/.ssh/id_ecdsa.pub -file release.tgz.sig release.tgz


MOTIVATION
Given the current doubts as to the cryptographic veracity of the
finite-field cryptography used by PGP, a stop-gap measure for
securing files was needed. sshsign uses the Cryptobox API, using
the strongest level of cryptography available at this time.


LICENSE
sshsign is released under the ISC license.


NOTE ON KEY RESTRICTIONS
521-bit ECDSA SSH keys should be the default for SSH as well ;
there's no performance reason not to. This also simplifies the code
and provides the maximum security level.
