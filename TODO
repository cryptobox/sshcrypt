TODO LIST

[X] change file handling to use io.{Reader,Writer}. The benefit to
    this is being able to read from stdin and write to stdout, which
    would make sshcrypt a useful middleware program.
[ ] Clean up codebase. This was hacked out as a reference, and while
    cryptographically secure, it would benefit from a general tidying-up
    of the code.
